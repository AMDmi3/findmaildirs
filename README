                                findmaildirs
                               ==============

  This is a very simple utility to be used with mutt to simplify automatic
  mailboxes management.

  It scans given directory for maildir-type mailboxes and prints list of
  them in mutt-compatible format, so its output may be used for `mailboxes'
  configuration directive of mutt.

Usecase
=======

  For example, you have a bunch of maildirs:

    ~/.mail
      inbox
        cur
        new
        tmp
      sent
        cur
        new
        tmp
      maillists
        lkml
          cur
          new
          tmp
        freebsd
          announce
            cur
            new
            tmp
          ports
            cur
            new
            tmp

  to make temp available in mutt, you need following in your .muttrc:

    set mbox_type=Maildir
    set folder="~/.mail"

    mailboxes +inbox +sent +maillists/lkml +maillists/freebsd/ports \
              +maildirs/freebsd/announce

  it's a pain to manage manually, especially of you have many mailboxes and
  even more especially if you have mailboxes created automatically for you
  by e.g. procmail.

  This utility manages it for you so you can just use:

    mailboxes `findmaildirs ~/.mail`
   
  Though it's extremely simple task and you could use simple `find | sed`
  pipeline instead, this utility acts a bit more clever and doesn't descend
  into subdirectories of mailboxes (cur, new and tmp) which may noticeably
  slow down mutt startup if there are many mail messages.
